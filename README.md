# Comma-Qt

An easy-to-use application for viewing and editing tabular files


## About

Tabular files, also known as spreadsheet files, are digital data storage formats that organize information into rows and columns, similar to a traditional spreadsheet. They are commonly used for storing and managing data in a structured manner, making it easier to analyze, manipulate, and visualize.

[Comma-Qt](https://rstammdev.github.io/comma-qt "Visit Comma-Qt's homepage") is a free open-source application for viewing and editing these tabular files written in C++ using the Qt framework.
